Foxy to Galactic
################

Moving from ROS 2 Foxy to Galactic, a number of stability improvements were added that we will not specifically address here.

NavigateToPose BT-node Interface Changes
****************************************

The NavigateToPose input port has been changed to PoseStamped instead of Point and Quaternion.

See :ref:`bt_navigate_to_pose_action` for more information.

BackUp BT-node Interface Changes
********************************

The ``backup_dist`` and ``backup_speed`` input ports should both be positive values indicating the distance to go backward respectively the speed with which the robot drives backward.

BackUp Recovery Interface Changes
*********************************

``speed`` in a backup recovery goal should be positive indicating the speed with which to drive backward.
``target.x`` in a backup recovery goal should be positive indicating the distance to drive backward.
In both cases negative values are silently inverted.

Groot Support
*************

Live Monitoring and Editing of behavior trees with Groot is now possible.
Switching bt-xmls on the fly through a new goal request is also included.
This is all done without breaking any APIs.
Enabled by default.

New Plugins
***********

``nav2_waypoint_follower`` has an action server that takes in a list of waypoints to follow and follow them in order. In some cases we might want robot to 
perform some tasks/behaviours at arrivals of these waypoints. In order to perform such tasks, a generic plugin interface `WaypointTaskExecutor` has been added to ``nav2_core``.
Users can inherit from this interface to implement their own plugin to perform more specific tasks at waypoint arrivals for their needs. 

Several example implementations are included in ``nav2_waypoint_follower``. ``WaitAtWaypoint`` and ``PhotoAtWaypoint`` plusings are included in 
``nav2_waypoint_follower`` as run-time loadable plugins. ``WaitAtWaypoint`` simply lets robot to pause for a specified amount of time in milliseconds, at waypoint arrivals.
 While ``PhotoAtWaypoint`` takes photos at waypoint arrivals and saves the taken photos to specified directory, the format for taken photos also can be configured through parameters.
 All major image formats such as ``png``, ``jpeg``, ``jpg`` etc. are supported, the default format is ``png``.

Loading a plugin of this type is done through ``nav2_bringup/params/nav2_param.yaml``, by specifying plugin's name, type and it's used parameters.

    waypoint_follower:
      ros__parameters:

Costmap Filters
***************

A new concept interacting with spatial-dependent objects called "Costmap Filters" appeared in Galactic (more information about this concept could be found at :ref:`concepts` page). Costmap filters are acting as a costmap plugins. In order to make a filtered costmap and change robot's behavior in annotated areas, filter plugin reads the data came from filter mask. Then this data is being linearly transformed into feature map in a filter space. It could be passability of an area, maximum speed limit in m/s, robot desired direction in degrees or anything else. Transformed feature map along with the map/costmap, sensors data and current robot position is used in plugin's algorithms to make required updates in the resulting costmap and robot's behavor.

Architecturally, costmap filters consists from ``CostmapFilter`` class which is a basic class incorporating much common of its inherited filter plugins:

- ``KeepoutFilter``: keep-out/safety zones filter plugin.
- ``SpeedFilter``: slow/speed-restricted areas filter.
- Preferred lanes in industries. This plugin is covered by ``KeepoutFilter`` (see discussion in `corresponding PR <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/1522>`_ for more details).

Each costmap filter subscribes to filter info topic (publishing by `Costmap Filter Info Publisher Server <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_map_server/src/costmap_filter_info>`_) having all necessary information for loaded costmap filter and filter mask topic.
``SpeedFilter`` additionally publishes maximum speed restricting `messages <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_msgs/msg/SpeedLimit.msg>`_ targeted for a Controller to enforce robot won't exceed given limit.

High-level design of this concept could be found `here <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/main/doc/design/CostmapFilters_design.pdf>`_. The functionality of costmap filters is being disscussed in `the ticket #1263 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/1263>`_ and carried out by `PR #1882 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/pull/1882>`_. The following tutorials: :ref:`navigation2_with_keepout_filter` and :ref:`navigation2_with_speed_filter` will help to easily get involved with ``KeepoutFilter`` and ``SpeedFilter`` functionalities.

SmacPlanner
***********

A new package, ``nav2_smac_planner`` was added containing 4 or 8 connected 2D A*, and Dubin and Reed-shepp model hybrid-A* with smoothing, multi-resolution query, and more.

The ``nav2_smac_planner`` package contains an optimized templated A* search algorithm used to create multiple A*-based planners for multiple types of robot platforms. We support differential-drive and omni-directional drive robots using the ``SmacPlanner2D`` planner which implements a cost-aware A* planner. We support cars, car-like, and ackermann vehicles using the ``SmacPlanner`` plugin which implements a Hybrid-A* planner. This plugin is also useful for curvature constrained planning, like when planning robot at high speeds to make sure they don't flip over or otherwise skid out of control.

The ``SmacPlanner`` fully-implements the Hybrid-A* planner as proposed in `Practical Search Techniques in Path Planning for Autonomous Driving <https://ai.stanford.edu/~ddolgov/papers/dolgov_gpp_stair08.pdf>`_, including hybrid searching, CG smoothing, analytic expansions and hueristic functions.

RegulatedPurePursuitController
******************************

A new package, ``nav2_regulated_pure_pursuit_controller`` was added containing a novel varient of the Pure Pursuit algorithm.
It also includes configurations to enable Pure Pursuit and Adaptive Pure Pursuit variations as well.

This variation is specifically targeting service / industrial robot needs.
It regulates the linear velocities by curvature of the path to help reduce overshoot at high speeds around blind corners allowing operations to be much more safe.
It also better follows paths than any other variation currently available of Pure Pursuit.
It also has heuristics to slow in proximity to other obstacles so that you can slow the robot automatically when nearby potential collisions.
It also implements the Adaptive lookahead point features to be scaled by velocities to enable more stable behavior in a larger range of translational speeds.

There's more this does, that that's the general information. See the package's ``README`` for more.

Costmap2D ``current_`` Usage
****************************

In costmap2D, ``current_`` was used in ROS1 to represent whether a costmap layer was still enabled and actively processing data. It would be turned to ``false`` only under the situation that the expected update rate of a sensor was not met, so it was getting stale or no messages. It acts as a fail-safe for if a navigation sensor stops publishing.

In galactic, that will remain turn, however it will also add additional capabilities. It is also now set to ``false`` when a costmap is reset due to clearing or other navigation recoveries. That stops the robot from creating a plan or control effort until after the costmap has been updated at least once after a reset. This enables us to make sure we cannot ever create a path or control with a completely empty costmap, potentially leading to collisions, due to clearing the costmap and then immediately requesting an algorithm to run.

Standard time units in parameters
*********************************
To follow the SI units outlined in REP-103 to the "T" nodes below were modified to use seconds consistently in every parameter. Under each node name you can see which parameters changed to seconds instead of using milliseconds.

- lifecycle manager 
 - ``bond_timeout_ms`` became ``bond_timeout`` in seconds
- smac planner
 - ``max_planning_time_ms`` became ``max_planning_time`` in seconds
- map saver
 - ``save_map_timeout`` in seconds

Ray Tracing Parameters
**********************
Raytracing functionality was modified to include a minimum range parameter from which ray tracing starts to clear obstacles to avoid incorrectly clearing obstacles too close to the robot. This issue was mentioned in `ROS Answers <https://answers.ros.org/question/355150/obstacles-in-sensor-deadzone/>`_. An existing parameter ``raytrace_range`` was renamed to ``raytrace_max_range`` to reflect the functionality it affects. The renamed parameters and the plugins that they belong to are mentioned below. The changes were introduced in this `pull request <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/pull/2126>`_.

- obstacle_layer plugin
 - ``raytrace_min_range`` controls the minimum range from which ray tracing clears obstacles from the costmap
 - ``raytrace_max_range`` controls the maximum range to which ray tracing clears obstacles from the costmap
- voxel_layer plugin
 - ``raytrace_min_range`` controls the minimum range from which ray tracing clears obstacles from the costmap
 - ``raytrace_max_range`` controls the maximum range to which ray tracing clears obstacles from the costmap

Obstacle Marking Parameters
***************************
Obstacle marking was modified to include a minimum range parameter from which obstacles are marked on the costmap to prevent addition of obstacles in the costmap due to noisy and incorrect measurements. This modification is related to the change with the raytracing parameters. The renamed parameters, newly added parameters and the plugins they belong to are given below.

- obstacle_layer plugin
 - ``obstacle_min_range`` controls the minimum range from which obstacle are marked on the costmap
 - ``obstacle_max_range`` controls the maximum range to which obstacles are marked on the costmap
- voxel_layer plugin
 - ``obstacle_min_range`` controls the minimum range from which obstacle are marked on the costmap
 - ``obstacle_max_range`` controls the maximum range to which obstacles are marked on the costmap

Recovery Action Changes
***********************
The recovery actions, ``Spin`` and ``BackUp`` were modified to correctly return ``FAILURE`` if the recovery action is aborted due to a potential collision. Previously, these actions incorrectly always returned ``SUCCESS``. Changes to this resulted in downstream action clients, such as the default behavior tree. The changes were introduced in this `pull request <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/pull/1855>`_.

Default Behavior Tree Changes
*****************************
The default behavior tree (BT) ``navigate_w_replanning_and_recovery.xml`` has been updated to allow for replanning in between recoveries. The changes were introduced in this `pull request <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/pull/1855>`_. Additionally, an alternative BT ``navigate_w_replanning_and_round_robin_recovery.xml`` was removed due to similarity with the updated default BT.
